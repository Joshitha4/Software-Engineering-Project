The database is called userDB.

The tables present are:

1. User
2. Seeker
3. Jobs
4. Applicant

## TODO:

- Add the date and time of when each applicant has applied as well. Basically make each of them more detailed by using DB lookups.
- Once a recruiter clicks on select candidate, the status of the application is changed to 'Selected'.
  Also note that you must update the status in 2 different places (Imp to update both).
- Proceed with next stage option for recruiter which allows then to send either a test or an interview link.
- Send selection and rejection mail functionality. The function I have already implemented, you jst have to write the detailed mail and update it.
- Do the google calendar API with nodejs. (for notifying about interview dates) //DONE
- Add chatbot feature
- One person should write all the unittests and integration tests
- We can also generate log files to demonstarte the last stage of monitoring and management.
